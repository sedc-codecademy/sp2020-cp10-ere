# Student projects 2020 - Client project 10 - SEDC [eRestaurant]

This front-end project is made for the purpose of the restaurant within SEAVUS. We worked as a team, with given mentor and held meetings with a web designer and a software tester. It required the use of HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery and GitHub. 
The user is able to look at the menu divided by categories and has an option to make orders. When the main page opens, the logo is in the upper left corner, and on the rights side are the Home, Menu, Contact , Cart and Login buttons. 
On the main page there are 8 most recommended products that are downloaded from the json file that we have created. 

## Menu 

By clicking the menu button we go directly to the page where all the products are located. However, they are divided into categories. Logically, when we click on breakfast, breakfast is opened, on drinks, only drinks and so on. 
There are also 3 ways we can view products. 3 in grid, 2 in grid and list. 

When the user clicks on a product, he first looks at the photo, the ingredients in that product, the allergens are displayed and on the right side are the ingredients that can be added optionally. A green arrow (ticked) appears when an item is added. In this way it is separated from other foods that have not been added. The price changes accordingly with the added ingredient. Below, in the footer of this modal are the options to choose whether to eat in the restaurant or the customer will pick up the packaged order. There is an option if he wants to order from the same product to increase the number of orders but limited to 10, and then by clicking on add to card that module closes. 

## Contact 

The contact page contains information about the working hours of the restaurant, contact phone and the address where it is located. These things are located on the right, while on the left is a type of contact form, where the user can write questions or comments. For this purpose, you should first write your name, email and phone number, otherwise without this information the message can not be sent. And after entering the data, there is a button that sends the message. 

## Cart 

When we add a product to the cart, a number appears next to the logo on the cart, respectively, if we add two products, the number 2 appears, if we add 3, the number 3 appears and so on. When we enter the shopping cart a modal appears in the right corner and displays the orders that the user has added previously. If he wants to view a product in detail in the cart, he has to click on the product and all the details appear in the list, and he can edit what he has selected, if he wants to make changes, or even completely delete the product from the basket. There are options to save the changes, and a button that would take it to the payment form. 

## Login / Register 

The login button opens a module where the username and password are entered. There is an option to remember this information, a button to login the user, but if it is not already registered, in the footer of the module there is a button that changes the content of that module and asks Registration information - Name and Surname, email, username, phone, password. There is an option to continue creating your account, or to return to the login option.
